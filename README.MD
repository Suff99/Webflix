# Webflix

A company in Edinburgh want to launch their new online streaming service called 'Webflix' that offers a wide variety of
TV programmes, films, and documentaries. Users can subscribe to the system as either a 'Basic' subscription which is
free or 'Premium' subscription for a fee (£99.99/year). Further details relating to the proposed system can be obtained
from the client (i.e. your lecturer), who will be available for a discussion in a weeks’ time.
